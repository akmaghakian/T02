I was required to do the following:

a) Declare a variable called hero that contains the value “$$$Superman$$$”

b) Use the string manipulation method strip() and print hero so the output is: Superman

c) Save the sentence: “The!quick!brown!fox!jumps!over!the!lazy!dog!.” as a
single string.

d) Reprint this sentence as “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazydog.” using the replace() function to replace every “!” exclamation mark with a blank space.

e) Reprint that sentence as: “THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.” using the upper() function

f) Print the sentence in reverse.
